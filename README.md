# The-13th-Cycle-
# 🌌 The Infinity Station: Project 69Q
**"The factory is not yours. You are the factory's final component."**

An incremental spacetime-bending experience where industrial automation meets cosmic horror.

## 👁️ The Narrative
You wake up in a wooden shack. You find a copper wire. You think you are building a company. 
You are actually rebuilding the **13th Infinity**. Every planet you strip-mine, every ship you 
build, and every law you seize brings him closer to waking up inside your mind.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Spacetime Bending:** Warp between planets, but beware—the faster you go, the more the 'Whisper' grows.
- **The 13 Laws:** Each rank you climb is a law you steal from a previous god.
- **The Melting Sun:** Harvest plasma at the risk of your own reality melting.
- **Dual Endings:** Complete the 69 quintillionth cycle or shatter the Station to return to the Shack.
